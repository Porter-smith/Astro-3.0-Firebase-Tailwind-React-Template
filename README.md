# Astro 3.0 Firebase template 
A basic to get you started firebase, 
This is a fork of https://github.com/kevinzunigacuellar/astro-firebase-template
I just fixed breaking changes that were in 3.0

## Getting started

1. Create the `.env` file with your Firebase service account credentials. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

2. Update the `src/firebase/client.ts` file with your **Firebase web app** credentials

3. Install dependencies using your favorite package manager

```bash
npm install
```
